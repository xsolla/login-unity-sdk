**THIS SDK IS DEPRECATED. USE [GAME COMMERCE SDK](https://github.com/xsolla/store-unity-sdk) INSTEAD.**

You can continue to use this SDK, but it will not be updated or supplemented with new features. We recommended that you [switch to the Game Commerce SDK](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity-deprecated/how-to-switch-to-commerce/). It contains all the classes and methods needed to work with Xsolla products.
