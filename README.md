# Login Unity SDK

Login Unity SDK is used to integrate [Xsolla Login API](https://developers.xsolla.com/api/v2/login/) methods with apps based on [Unity](https://unity.com/).

* storing user data at Xsollaâ€™s side
* authentication via email/username and password

Target OS:
* iOS
* Android
* Linux
* Mac OS
* Windows 32-bit
* Windows 64-bit

**Info:** The integration demo is available in the **Assets > Xsolla > AuthDemo** folder. You can use it as an example.

## System Requirements

* 64-bit OS
* Windows 7 SP1 and higher
